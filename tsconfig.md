- allowSyntheticDefaultImports
  - to write `import React from 'react'` instead of `import * as React from 'react'`
- declaration
  - emit Type Definition Files for your exported ones
- jsx
  - supports `preserve`, `react`, and `react-native`
  - `preverse` outputs `jsx` and leaves the transpiling to Babel
  - `react` outputs `js` and transpiles to `React.createNode`
- lib
  - defines what language features are allowed
  - should be `target` + polyfilled features like `"ES2020.BigInt"`
- module
  - what module system your target supports. _ES5 ? CommonJs : ES6_
  - don't use ESNext, as it includes e.g. ES2020 export-ns-from, what is not supported by < TS v3.8
- moduleResolution
  - always `node`
- target
  - newest ES version your oldest supported browser supports
  - used to transpile language syntax like arrow functions
- outDir
  - needed when using `declaration`.
  - Besides declaration files both output and `include` are otherwise configured via webpack.
