## Compiler Options
- allowSyntheticDefaultImports
  - to write `import React from 'react'` instead of `import * as React from 'react'`
- declaration
  - emit Type Definition Files for your exported ones
  - `declarationDir` is needed because webpack's output config is not used for this
- jsx
  - supports `preserve`, `react`, and `react-native`
  - `preverse` outputs `jsx` and leaves the transpiling to Babel
  - `react` outputs `js` and transpiles to `React.createNode`
- lib
  - defines what language features are allowed
  - should be `target` + polyfilled features like `["ES2016", "ES2017.Object"]`
  - acts like `<=` so `ES2016` also allows complete `ES2015`
  - should be mirroring Babel's support (ES2015-ES2020 as of now) for it picks the polyfills
- module
  - target module system (commonJs would transform `import` to `require`)
  - what module system your target supports. `ES5 ? CommonJs : ES2015`
  - with webpack though it does not matter, since webpack uses its own import-system. That's why ES2020 for dynamic imports can be used regardless of the `target`.
- moduleResolution
  - always `node`
- target
  - target ES version
  - should be the newest the oldest targeted browser supports
  - used to transpile language syntax like arrow functions
  - while language features still need to be polyfilled (e.g. with Babel) and added to `lib`
- types
  - defines the global types (so not types of respective ES imports)
  - loads all `node_modules/@types` by default (typically node, jest, express)
  - this default import of `node` affects `lib` in an undesired way.

## Config a level higher
- exclude & include
  - include defaults to `[**/*]` if `files` is not set
  - exclude defaults to `[node_modules]`
  - so by default the folder and subfolders as well as imported ambient folders
  - `skipLibCheck` can be set to ignore d.ts files of ambient module imports
